# AM-PM

A collection of Python scripts for **portfolio construction, active management, and risk monitoring**, built on market data (Yahoo Finance) and the options chain from **Polygon.io**.

The repository combines classical portfolio optimization (mean-variance, quadratic utility, minimum variance, Black-Litterman) with forward-looking information extracted from the options market: implied volatility, Bakshi-Kapadia-Madan (BKM) risk-neutral moments, dealer gamma exposure (GEX), order flow, and Cornish-Fisher expansions for tail risk.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: this code is quantitative research and analysis material. It is not investment advice. The default parameters (portfolios, tickers, rates) are examples and should be adjusted before any real use.

## Workflow architecture

The scripts run independently, but they are designed to chain together: the output of an optimizer (a `ticker: weight` dictionary) becomes the input for the management and risk modules.

### `risk_estimators.py`
A dependency-free (numpy/pandas/scipy only) module holding the estimation logic
the optimizers share, so the same choices are not re-implemented five times:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cov_ewma_shrunk` | EWMA covariance + Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage toward a constant-correlation target. Replaces the equal-weighted sample covariance. |
| `q_to_p_vol` / `q_to_p_correlation` | Risk-neutral → physical corrections for the variance and correlation risk premia. |
| `standardized_panel` / `rescale_panel` / `portfolio_moments` | Portfolio skewness and kurtosis from co-moments, in `O(J·n)`, instead of averaging marginal moments. |
| `portfolio_moment_gradients` | Analytic gradients of σ, skew and excess kurtosis, for Euler-style marginal CVaR contributions. |
| `higher_moments_admissible` | Checks that a (skewness, kurtosis) pair is possible (K ≥ 1 + S²) and below a sanity ceiling. Used to reject bad BKM integrations instead of clipping them. |
| `cornish_fisher_tail` / `var_cvar_cornish_fisher` / `cornish_fisher_es_gradient` | Cornish-Fisher quantile and closed-form ES built from the **actual** skewness and kurtosis (Maillard, 2012): the expansion parameters are solved so the resulting distribution has those moments, which keeps the quantile monotone in S and K. |
| `martin_wagner_excess_return` | **Experimental, off by default.** Expected return from risk-neutral variance. The formula is not verified against the source paper — see the warning in the module. |

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- A [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io) API key (the options modules will not work without one)

Libraries used:

| Area | Packages |
|---|---|
| Data and computation | `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`, `python-dateutil` |
| Market data | `yfinance`, `pandas-datareader`, `beautifulsoup4` |
| Statistics / optimization | `scipy`, `statsmodels`, `quadprog` |
| Visualization | `plotly`, `matplotlib` |
| Environment | `python-dotenv` |

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isaac17e/AM-PM.git
cd AM-PM

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install numpy pandas requests python-dateutil \
            yfinance pandas-datareader beautifulsoup4 \
            scipy statsmodels quadprog \
            plotly matplotlib python-dotenv
```

`quadprog` requires a C compiler. On Windows it is usually easier to install it from a prebuilt wheel.

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the repository root (it is already covered by `.gitignore`):

```env
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Every script loads it via `load_dotenv()`. If the key is missing, the optimizers print a warning and fall back to historical methods, while the options-driven modules (`black_litterman.py` with `USAR_IV_POLYGON = True`, `portfolio_gex_field.py`, `active_management.py`, `entry_signal_tool.py`) will not run correctly.

**Parameters are edited directly in the configuration block at the top of each file.** There is no CLI and no external config file: each script runs with `python script_name.py` and opens its Plotly charts in the browser.

## Scripts

### 1. Portfolio construction

#### `quadratic_utility.py` (~2,460 lines)
Portfolio optimizer based on **quadratic utility maximization** (`U = μ'w − λ/2 · w'Σw`).

Pipeline:
1. Builds the universe (top S&P 500 and NASDAQ names via scraping, commodities, ETFs, and international tickers), mapping currency by ticker suffix and converting prices to USD through FX pairs.
2. Computes descriptive statistics, correlations, and **Fama-French 3-factor betas** (`pandas_datareader`).
3. **Joint candidate selection via QUBO/Ising**: brute force when the search space is small, simulated annealing otherwise, with an objective blending Sharpe, low volatility, and decorrelation.
4. Applies sequential filters: delta, recent volatility, IV vs. realized volatility, and a **BKM MFIS filter** (flags anomalous hedging vs. speculation via a z-score against the asset's own historical MFIS).
5. Builds the covariance matrix as a **shrinkage between implied (BKM) and historical covariance**. The historical leg is estimated from **daily** returns with EWMA weighting and Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage, not from the monthly sample covariance. Implied volatilities and implied correlations are converted from the risk-neutral to the physical measure before use.
6. Optimizes with `quadprog` and produces: efficient frontier, lambda comparison, risk attribution by Greeks, maximum drawdown analysis, and an executive summary.

Key parameters: `lambda_`, `max_weight`, `horizon_months`, `target_total_tickers`, `bkm_z_threshold`, `cornish_fisher_confidence`, `cov_halflife_days`, `use_q_to_p_vol`, `use_q_to_p_correlation`.

#### `minimum_variance.py` (~2,100 lines)
Optimizer for **minimum prospective tail risk (BKM + Cornish-Fisher)**, an evolution of the classical minimum-variance approach.

- Replaces the traditional volatility filter with a **Cornish-Fisher VaR** ranking built from risk-neutral moments.
- **Implied correlation model by factors**: market + sector + country + FX.
- Blends the factor covariance with a historical one estimated from **daily** returns via EWMA + Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage. Implied volatilities are converted from the risk-neutral to the physical measure (`use_q_to_p_vol`) before entering Σ.
- Portfolio tail risk is measured from the **co-moments** of an empirical scenario panel, so skewness and kurtosis diversify. The pruning loop's marginal CVaR contribution uses the analytic gradients of those co-moments.
- Configurable constraints: max/min weight per asset, maximum number of holdings, ETF participation (`etf_max_weight`), and currency exposure (`max_fx_exposure`).
- Outputs: efficient frontier, Plotly visualizations, and synthetic risk attribution using Black-Scholes Greeks.

#### `black_litterman.py` (~1,100 lines)
**Black-Litterman** implementation over a manually defined ticker universe.

- Equilibrium returns `π` from reverse CAPM, using market capitalizations as reference weights.
- Implied volatility from Polygon with an **SSVI** surface fit and PCHIP interpolation.
- **BKM** module for higher-order risk-neutral moments, used as a bridge to systematically construct `Q` and `Ω` (the views and their uncertainty).
- The correlation structure behind `Σ`, `Σ_P` and `Σ_BL` comes from **daily** returns with EWMA weighting and Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage (`USAR_COV_DIARIA`, `COV_HALFLIFE_DIAS`).
- Converts risk-neutral moments to the physical measure before optimizing (`COTA_RATIO_VOL_P`), and computes portfolio moments over an entropy-pooled scenario panel — so skewness and kurtosis diversify correctly. These two were already the model's strongest points and are unchanged.
- **MVSK** optimization (mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis) instead of pure mean-variance.
- Predefined risk profiles (`conservador`, `moderado`, `agresivo`) that set `tau`, `omega_scale`, and `gamma_ra`.
- Reports a `CF_exacta` flag alongside the risk metrics: when it is 0, the portfolio's (skewness, kurtosis) pair is not reachable by the Cornish-Fisher family and the nearest reachable pair was used.
- Includes maximum drawdown analysis of the resulting portfolio.

Manager views are edited in **Block 6** of the file.

#### Seasonal versions
`minimum_variance_(seasonal_version).py` and `quadratic_utility_(seasonal_version).py` mirror the pipelines above, but restrict the analysis to **specific months of the year** (`execution_months` / `rebalance_months`, defaulting to `[9]`).

Two things change:
- The **per-asset Cornish-Fisher VaR filter** is computed over the historical seasonal window rather than the full series (`seasonal_min_weeks` sets the minimum number of valid observations). Note that the **covariance matrix deliberately still uses the full sample**: restricting Σ to one month of the year would leave roughly four observations per year, and the estimation error would swamp any seasonal signal.
- An exclusion filter on `seasonal_vol_ratio_max` is added: if an asset's seasonal volatility exceeds its general volatility by more than that multiple, it is dropped; `seasonal_min_survivors` prevents the universe from emptying out.

Use these when optimizing for a specific entry month rather than a generic horizon.

### 2. Active management and entry signals

#### `active_management.py` (~790 lines)
**Tactical rebalancing** engine for an existing portfolio, driven by options-market microstructure.

Blocks:
1. Options chain extraction and processing (Polygon v3, with pagination and retries).
2. Microstructure metrics: **GEX** (gamma exposure) and the zero-gamma flip point, order flow, unusual options activity (UOA), sweep dominance, put/call ratio, and **vanna-charm** effects.
3. A weighted **tactical score** (`score_gex_weight`, `score_flow_sweep`, `score_pcr_scale`, …) that maps to a per-asset recommendation.
4. Rebalancing with explicit thresholds: increase (score ≥ 50), hold, trim (≤ −50), with freed cash allocated up to the `cash_reserve_limit` cap (30% by default).
5. Reporting: gamma profiles consolidated onto a single page, plus a before/after allocation chart.

Input: the `portfolio` dictionary and `investment_horizon_days` at the top of the file.

#### `entry_signal_tool.py` (~310 lines)
A lightweight **entry-timing conviction score**. For each ticker it computes eight indicators and normalizes them by historical percentile:

| Indicator | Weight |
|---|---|
| GEX regime | 0.18 |
| Distance to zero gamma | 0.15 |
| IV rank | 0.15 |
| Room to the walls | 0.12 |
| Skew | 0.10 |
| Expected move | 0.10 |
| Smart money | 0.10 |
| Relative volume | 0.10 |

The resulting score (0-100) maps to a **suggested entry percentage**: full entry above 75, a graduated partial entry between 40 and 75, and a minimal entry below that.

Each run persists results to `entry_signal_history.csv` (one row per ticker per day, replacing the same day's row if it already exists). That history is what feeds the percentiles, so **the first few runs produce weak signals** until enough history accumulates.

It respects Polygon's free-tier limit by waiting `SEGUNDOS_ENTRE_LLAMADAS_STOCKS` (13 s) between tickers.

### 3. Risk and visualization

#### `portfolio_risk_score_leverage.py` (~990 lines)
A two-layer risk pipeline plus a leverage module:

- **Ex-post risk (historical)**: annualized volatility, historical VaR and CVaR at 95% and 99%, drawdowns, and risk-adjusted ratios (configurable MAR).
- **Ex-ante risk (options)**: ATM IV, GEX profile, and put/call ratio by open interest, sourced from Polygon.
- **Dynamic per-asset leverage**: a 0-100 `Risk_Score` weighting HV (30%), CVaR (30%), IV (25%), and the GEX/PCR block (15%), mapped inversely to a leverage range between `leverage_min` (2.0) and `leverage_max` (5.0).

Ends with a tabular report and per-asset charts.

#### `portfolio_gex_field.py` (~980 lines)
A 3D visualization of the portfolio as a **composite force field**.

- X axis: price in sigma units (±3σ, 60-point resolution).
- Y axis: composite macro factor (VIX 50%, TNX 25%, DXY 25%).
- Z axis: potential surface derived from smoothed net GEX, with macro amplification (`BETA_MACRO_AMPLIFICATION`) and tilt (`GAMMA_MACRO_TILT`).

Portfolio positions are plotted on the surface along with gradient vectors indicating the path of least resistance. Output is written to `portfolio_gex_field.html` with **auto-refresh every 60 seconds** (`REFRESH_SECONDS`), optional camera rotation, and automatic browser launch. This is the only script meant to be left running in a loop.

## Key concepts

- **BKM (Bakshi, Kapadia, and Madan, 2003)**: extraction of *risk-neutral* variance, skewness, and kurtosis (MFIV, MFIS, MFIK) by integrating OTM option prices. Used here as a forward-looking risk estimator, in contrast to historical moments.
- **Cornish-Fisher**: an expansion that adjusts normal quantiles for skewness and kurtosis, producing a VaR/CVaR sensitive to fat tails. The S and K in the formula are *parameters*, not the moments of the resulting distribution; plugging observed moments in directly leaves the monotonicity domain for heavy tails and, even inside it, can rank a more negatively skewed asset as *safer*. The scripts therefore solve for the parameters that reproduce the observed moments (Maillard, 2012), projecting onto the nearest reachable pair when needed. BKM moment pairs that violate K ≥ 1 + S² or exceed `bkm_mfik_max` are discarded rather than clipped: the MFIV is kept, and MFIS/MFIK become NaN (or neutral 0/3 in Black-Litterman).
- **Risk-neutral vs. physical measure (Q vs. P)**: the implied density is the physical one reweighted by the pricing kernel, so implied moments carry risk premia. Implied variance exceeds physical variance (the variance risk premium) and implied correlation exceeds realized correlation (the correlation risk premium). Feeding raw Q moments to an optimizer overstates risk and understates diversification, so the scripts estimate a bounded per-asset Q→P ratio from realized data before building Σ.
- **EWMA + Ledoit-Wolf**: the historical covariance is estimated from daily returns, exponentially weighted toward the recent regime, then shrunk toward a constant-correlation target. Covariance precision improves with sampling frequency while the mean's does not (Merton, 1980), and shrinkage corrects the downward bias of the small eigenvalues that a minimum-variance optimizer loads on (Michaud).
- **Co-moments**: portfolio skewness and kurtosis depend on the M3 and M4 tensors, not on the marginal moments alone. Averaging per-asset MFIS/MFIK implicitly assumes perfect dependence and does not diversify; the error grows roughly with √n for weakly correlated assets. The scripts evaluate the exact quantities over a scenario panel in `O(J·n)`.
- **GEX (Gamma Exposure)**: aggregate dealer gamma exposure. Positive GEX is associated with range-bound markets (dealers dampen moves); negative GEX with amplified moves. The zero-gamma flip marks the boundary between the two regimes.
- **Implied/historical shrinkage**: the final covariance is a weighted blend of the implied-volatility estimate and the historical one, with the weight controlled by `shrinkage_min`, `shrinkage_max`, and `ratio_band`.
- **QUBO/Ising**: asset selection is framed as a quadratic binary optimization problem, where the `h_i` terms capture individual quality and `J_ij` penalizes correlation.

---

## Notes on the Polygon API

- The free *Stocks Basic* tier allows **5 calls per minute**; several scripts include pauses and retries (`polygon_max_retries`, `polygon_retry_wait_sec`, `SEGUNDOS_ENTRE_LLAMADAS_STOCKS`) to stay within it.
- The optimizers iterate over hundreds of tickers, so on the free tier a full run can take hours. Lower `n_top_sp500`, `n_top_nasdaq`, and `target_total_tickers` for quick tests.
- `bkm_max_workers` controls parallelism in the BKM filter; raise it only if your plan allows.
- When an options query fails, the code falls back to a historical method (no real BKM) and reports it in the output. Always check the **data quality** section at the end of the optimizers.
